These are Python routines utilizing [Atomistic Simulation Environment (ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) and [LAMMPS](http://lammps.sandia.gov/) to perform basic tests of atomistic potentials. (See [CCP 2011 presentation](http://www.cavs.msstate.edu/publications/docs/2011/11/9288present.pdf)/[paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/402/1/012006) for a summary.) ASE is used to create atomic configurations for LAMMPS, to write input scripts for LAMMPS, and to read results from LAMMPS output files, as advocated in the [NIST workshop presentation](http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/Download/2011Workshop/Jelinek_NIST_2011.pdf). Evaluated properties are: formation energies and volumes of point defects (vacancies, substitutions, and interstitials), formation energies of basic surfaces, heats of formation of simple binary compounds, and elastic constants. These routines were used to test MEAM and other classical MD potentials in the [PRB article](http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.85.245102) and should allow quick reproduction of results therein. Flexibility of LAMMPS allows easy switching between varying semi-empirical potentials, while ASE allows to compare results of LAMMPS with a multitude of ab-initio codes.
